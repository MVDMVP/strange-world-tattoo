        <p>We offer one complimentary touch-up within a six-month window from the day of your initial tattoo application. 
          We recommend waiting a minimum of two months, allowing your tattooed skin to fully heal, before scheduling your touch-up.

          For optimal results, it's important to allow the tattoo to fully set before reworking any existing ink. 
          As a rule of thumb; if your tattoo still appears shiny and doesn't blend seamlessly with the surrounding skin, it is not yet ready for a touch-up.
        </p>
