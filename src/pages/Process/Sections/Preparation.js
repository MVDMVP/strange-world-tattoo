        <h2>BEFORE YOUR APPOINTMENT</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Getting a tattoo can be a significant decision that requires careful planning and preparation. Learn here how to prepare your tattoo to ensure your experience is safe and enjoyable</p>
      <div className="group"></div>
      <ul className='list numbered'>
        <li>If you would like to make changes to your tattoo; communicate it with your artist sooner rather than later. While small changes can sometimes be accommodated, it is best to give your artist at least a days notice of any changes - big or small. This will help ensure your new changes work well with the existing design, as well as ensure your appointment can be completed on time
        <br />
        Please note, changes that cannot be accommodated for include:
          <ul className='list lettered'>
            <li>significant changes without giving the artist enough time to prepare</li>
            <li>changes in appointment duration which would lead to overlap with a later appointment</li>
          </ul>
          If requested changes cannot be accommodated, you may reschedule your appointment for a later date; however, you may need to make another deposit to secure your new appointment if said changes are requested within 72 hours / 3 days of your appointment
        </li>
        <li>Make sure you are clean and showered for your appointment. It is important to reduce bacteria and germs on the skin, which in turn will greatly reduce the risk of infection during any healing process. It also makes it easier on the artist, as they have a cleaner and smoother surface to work on. Most importantly it is a sign of respect towards the artist and their workspace, and allows a more comfortable experience for all parties.</li>
        <li>Avoid: alcohol, caffeine, and aspirin. These substances can thin your blood; leading to excessive bleeding - which can affect the final outcome of the tattoo - and also lead to general discomfort during your appointment. Feel free to bring snacks and a drink - especially for longer sessions.</li>
        <li>Wear comfortable clothing that allows access to the area to be tattooed. Keep in mind when selecting wardrobe that there may be some ink and blood that may splatter or smear on your clothes</li>
        <li>Don't go over the top with hair removal at the tattoo site! If the site does contain excess hair you may optionally trim the area. Your tattoo artist may also use a razor to remove hair without irritating the skin</li>
        <li>It is essential to inform the artist if you plan on using numbing creams. These creams can lead to increased bleeding and a temporary change in the skins texture - potentially resulting in a deficiency.</li>
        <li>When inviting guests to join you for your appointment, we would ask you to please be considerate of the limited space we all share at the studio, and that the less distractions there are - the better.</li>
