      <h2>BOOKING YOUR APPOINTMENT</h2>
      <p>Our booking page, with a button conveniently located at the top right of our website is the best way for clients to request any and all services detailed in our SERVICES page</p>
      <p>Upon clicking the button, you will be directed to our booking form designed to capture all details pertaining towards your appointment</p>
      <p>This will be used to begin an email thread with the designated/assigned artist to finalize the details of your appointment</p>
      <br />
      <p>Make sure to book your appointment for a date/time you know you will be in good condition for. On the day of your appointment, if you are at all sick, hungover or otherwise unwell, we recommend calling in to reschedule. Make sure you are well rested, hydrated, and have had a healthy meal to provide you with energy throughout the appointment. </p>
      <br />
      <p>If you would like to come in for an appointment today or tomorrow, it would be best to call the shop at +1(289) 837-4496 to check for walk-in availability</p>
      <p>Typically this would be for quick appointments - such as small tattoos, piercings, etc</p>
