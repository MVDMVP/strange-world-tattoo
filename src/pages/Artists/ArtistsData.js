    bio: "I tat n own da place yakno",
    longBio: "I was born in South Africa and migrated to Canada in 1991 when I was 8 years old.  I have always loved painting with acrylics, but didn't know how to turn that into a career until one day - in 2012 - I decided to google 'how to make money from painting pictures?'. Tattooing came up in my search! At first, I wasn't sure if I would fit into the industry, but I followed my gut and jumped into it.  Urban Ink in Mississauga took me on as an apprentice and I had the honour to apprentice under some amazing artists.  Once my apprenticeship was done in 2013, I spread my wings and worked at Follow The Son in Fort McMurray for two and a half years. Following the birth of my beautiful son, we decide to move back home, where I then joined the team at Rockstar Ink  in Hamilton for a few years. Finally, with the support of my amazing husband, I took a leap and opened The Golden Pearl in November 2018.  I specialize in black and grey realism and stipple work.  I no longer do colour pieces."

    bio: "I like them dainty tings wagwan",
    longBio: "I have always loved drawing and creating projects.  I love expressing myself in any form of art, whether itâ€™s drawing, painting, dancing, singing, etc.. Growing up, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but I knew I wanted a future in the arts. In 2017, I came across a tattoo shop in Mississauga looking for apprentices, so I applied for the position and the rest is history!  I was able to learn, and gain a number of skills at that shop. After two years, I decided to leave to further grow my knowledge and skills. That's when I joined the team at The Golden Pearl. I love doing floral work and stippling, but am also open to various styles.",

    bio: "I be tattin but im from hamilton :(",
    longBio: "I was born and raised in Hamilton Ontario.  I started painting in high school and continued developing my fine art skills at Sheridan College.  I studied Visual and Creative Arts for three years, with the dream of landing a tattoo apprenticeship after my graduation.  While in school, I started getting tattooed by Jen and dropping hints that I would love to apprentice.  It took some time, but my dreams came true! I started my apprenticeship in July 2019 at The Golden Pearl, and finished my apprenticeship by July 2020. ",

    title: "Artist",
    bio: "I'm just glad im not from hamilton yakno",
    longBio: " Since I was a kid, I loved art and drawing. I've always been fascinated by nature, especially animals and flowers, which always held a special place in my art. In September of 2020, with the influence of my twin sister, I decided to pursue tattooing. I was excited with the idea of being able to immortalize art not just on paper canvases. I worked with my sister at her private shop, developing my skills, learning and seeking my own style by bringing the inspiration from my drawings. I then moved to Canada to broaden my horizons. My goal is to learn new techniques, meet new people and boost my art to the next level. "
